# Urban-Data-Analytics-Open-Data-Repository

This GitHub repository curates open, reproducible urban datasets that students can use for class exercises and their final research projects for CRPLAN 5380. The recommended datasets are all publicly available, commonly used in academic and professional urban research, and suitable for semester-long projects.
